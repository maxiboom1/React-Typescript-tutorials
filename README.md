# React-Typescript-tutorials

## Concepts

My main goal is to summarize the coding techniques we used to do in React with Typescript.

## Interpolation

> Wrapping the variables inline.
```
const percent = 10;
<span>Only today - {percent}% off on all store shoes!</span>
```

## Conditional rendering

> Show the content on specific condition.

Interpolation: 
```
{isWeakend() ? <span>Pizza 🍕 </span> : <span>Cake🎂</span>}
```
